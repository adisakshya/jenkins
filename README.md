Jenkins is a leading open source automation server, it provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

As an organization matures from a continuous delivery standpoint, its building-deploying and automating requirements will similarly grow. 
Jenkins supports the "master/agent" mode, to support distributed build environment, where the workload of building projects are delegated to multiple agents.

This repository contains docker image of a Jenkins master, which can be used in a distributed build architecture.

In a distributed builds environment, the Jenkins master will use its resources to only handle HTTP requests and manage the build environment. Actual execution of builds will be delegated to the agents. With this configuration it is possible to horizontally scale an architecture, which allows a single Jenkins installation to host a large number of projects and build environments.
